<strong>Horiseon SSS Webpage Refactor</strong>
<br />
Horiseon Social Solution Services provides clients with services that help to increase their likelihood to appear in relevant searches on web browsers. Horiseon provided an index.html that was in need of refactoring in order to help consolidate unnecessary code as well as increase accessibility regarding accessibility features implemented into web browsers. Increasing the structural heirarchy of the HTML and reducing unnecessary CSS code allowed for the same site look to render while achieving their desired goals.
